/*
* 1) Color variables involve a two-tier system to keep colors in sync. The
*    first tier defines the brand and neutral colors, and the second tier
*    defines the application of those colors.
*/

/*
* Brand Colors
* 1) Brand color variables use English names to define colors to make palettes easier to
*    identify. Names are generated using this tool: http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/
* 2) Brand color variables should typically not be used directly in Sass partials. Instead, use
*    second-tier application colors.
